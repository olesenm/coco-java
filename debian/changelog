coco-java (20081106-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Minor change: code cleanup.
  * Minor change: More robust Scanner, never assign Buffer.EOF to a char (which
                  results in an overflow, should do no harm).

coco-java (20081001-3) unstable; urgency=low

coco-java (20081001-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Bugfix: bug in the construction of the scanner automaton fixed.
  * Minor change: More robust Peek method is Scanner.
  * Minor change: Literal check is now handled by a hash-table-lookup instead
    of an if-else-if cascade.
  * Minor change: Allow underscores (_) in identifiers.

coco-java (20070906-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor Bugfix: Allow buffer position to be set to the end of the file,
    this allows grammars without trailing new-line.

coco-java (20070906-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enhanced support for input streams: Previously we did support files via
    file names and file streams via input streams, but not non seek-able
    streams (e.g. network). Now we support both stream types. Please note
    since our memory buffer keeps the entire history of a stream, the maximum
    supported stream size is limited by the available memory and the runtime
    environment.
  * The possibility to set the output path with command line option "-o".
  * The main method returns 1 if the grammar contained an error.

coco-java (20061206-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The declaration of standard whitespaces (namely space) is again done in
    the file Scanner.frame.

coco-java (20060919-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * It's now a non native package (Closes: 396539).

coco-java (20060919-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Misplaced resolvers cause warnings instead of errros now.
  * The scanners generated by Coco/R can now also process Unicode
    characters in UTF-8 format. This implies that Coco/R itself
    supports UTF-8 now.
  * Attributes may now also contain the characters '<' and '>'
    (e.g. for operators or generic types). Such attributes must
    be enclosed in <. and .> brackets.
  * Error messages are written to an error stream instead of to the console.
    The error stream can be changed by the user.
  * The scanner now also recognizes the Unicode byte order mark for UTF-8.

coco-java (20051117-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The if else if cascade of an alternative does not get optimized to a
    switch statement anymore if the alternative contains a LL(1) warning,
    thus coco generates at least compileable code in such a situation.

 -- Markus Loeberbauer <Loeberbauer@ssw.jku.at>  Thu, 17 Nov 2005 17:00:00 +0100

coco-java (20050926-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Constant declarations are generated for pragma names in the parser now
    (in case you want to access those names in semantic actions).

 -- Markus Loeberbauer <Loeberbauer@ssw.jku.at>  Tue, 27 Sep 2005 19:18:00 +0100

coco-java (20050919-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fixed in Tab.cs. Coco reported a misplaced resolver if 2 alternatives
    at the end of a production were deletable and a resolver was placed
    in front of the first one.

 -- Markus Loeberbauer <Loeberbauer@ssw.jku.at>  Mon, 19 Sep 2005 16:00:00 +0100

coco-java (20050504-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream release
  * Small bug in DFA fixed (EOF was not recognized correctly if ANY was used).
  * Coco/R as well as the generated compilers are reentrant now.
    That means that all fields and methods are non-static.
    Please look at the user manual to see how to create and
    initialize a scanner and a parser object in your compiler.
  * In addition to bracket comments (/* ... */), ATG files can also contain
    end of line comments now (// ... cr lf)
  * Corrected some package troubles. (Closes: #306622)

coco-java (20050316-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Scanners can read arbitrariliy large files now (needed for
    parsing log files with several hundred megabytes).
  * Generated scanners are substantially faster than before (about 30%).

coco-java (20050111-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload to Debian unstable.
    Sponsor: Rene Mayrhofer <rmayr@debian.org>
  * Renamed to coco-java.
  * Lexical structures like '(' {char} ')' resulted in an endless loop in
    the scanner if char was defined as ANY - ')' and if the terminating ')'
    was missing in the input stream of the generated compiler.

cocosourcesjava (2004.10.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * If an expression in curly braces or square brackets is deletable
    (as in [[x]]) a new  LL(1) warning is printed: contents of [...]
    or {...} must not be deletable.

cocosourcesjava (2004.10.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Blanks are specified as white space in the scanner frame now, so one can
    delete this if one doesn't want to ignore blanks.
    (Caution! Use the latests Coco.jar only with the latest Scanner.frame!)

    System.getProperty("file.seperator").

cocosourcesjava (2004.06.28-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix in DFA.java, buggy code was generated for CONTEXT phrases.
  * Bug fix in Coco.atg, invalid Token Factors and Terms caused Coco to crash.

 -- Markus Loeberbauer <Loeberbauer@ssw.jku.at>  Tue, 27 Jul 2004 10:09:00 +0100

cocosourcesjava (2004.06.28-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Generation of case-insensitive compilers changed
    - keyword IGNORECASE instead of IGNORE CASE.
    - case is also ignored in tokens and character sets now.
    - User manual changed
  * The scanner uses '\u0100' instead of '\u0' as an end of file (eof)
    character now. This allowes \0 to be used in tokens (useful for parsing
    binary files).
  * Bug fix in the detection of tokens that cannot be distinguished.
  * IO routines changed from Java 1.0 to Java 1.1.
  * Various cleanups.
